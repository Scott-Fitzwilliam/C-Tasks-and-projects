i need it to first print any spaces required
the print the needed x'spaces
then a newline
the spaces need to increment at x/2
i need it to create enough x's to work for odd and even, 2 increment cannot work

int spacesRequired = (MaxWidth - xRequired)/2; with increments of 2 always allow for single increases in speaces
but it doesn't allow for proper x allocation
therefore x allocation must be seperate from 2 increments. Seperate for based on xrequired is neccessary




2nd centered:
needs to start at zero and increment +=2 with xrequired = oddOrEven, where xrequired < Maxwidth
oddOrEven = Maxwidth % 2 as this will give 1 for odd and 0 for even, giving dynamic range 
to xRequired as setting a zero with increments prevents odd printings of x and vice versa for 1



this time spaces are still required first, however they need to be Maxwidth/2 straight away to centered
this can be done by making it =(MaxWidth- xrequired)/2 where  xcount starts at 0 or 1 as if it is 
7 then 7 - 1 = 3spaces, which is desired effect

xcpunt needs to work the smae way as before, odd and even should allow for correct printings
// forgot that the oppoisite symbal to > isn't < it is <= and therefore that change was needed for 
xRequired for it to created 1 x properly

need to remove space at begining when xrequired = 0 for even numbers
created if statement that says if( xrequired !=0) do this otherwise just do nothing.

Perfect they are all done.
